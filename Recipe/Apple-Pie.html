</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 cup unsalted butter (cold, cut into cubes)</li>
  <li>6–8 tablespoons ice water</li>
  <li>6–7 apples (peeled, cored, and sliced)</li>
  <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (for filling)</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
  <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
  <li>1 egg (for egg wash)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F).</li>
  <li>To make the crust, mix flour and butter until crumbly, then add ice water slowly until dough forms. Divide in two and chill for 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>In a large bowl, toss apples with sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice.</li>
  <li>Roll out one portion of dough and place in a pie dish. Add apple filling.</li>
  <li>Roll out second dough and cover the pie. Crimp edges and cut slits in the top for steam to escape.</li>
  <li>Brush the top with beaten egg.</li>
  <li>Bake for 45–50 minutes or until golden brown and bubbly.</li>
  <li>Cool slightly before serving. Enjoy warm or chilled.</li>
